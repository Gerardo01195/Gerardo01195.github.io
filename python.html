	<p>in this game you have to reach the other side of the starting point to win the game.</p>
	<p>by moving using the W,A,S,D keys on the keyboard.</p>

	<p>as you can see here this is the code for the enemy's(rectangles) color and speed so dont think its not possible :).</p>
	<p>One thing we had trouble on is the movement of the collision of the enemies.</p>
